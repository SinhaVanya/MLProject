1. Create repository in Github by clicking new and Give the name and create repository.
2. Open the folder in vscode
3. Create environment

    Open the terninal and open command prompt in it.
    conda create -p venv python==3.8 -y
    cls- clear screen
    conda activate venv/

4. Create a Readme file

    This is a file where you can write project description

5. First we will see if we sink with repository.

    git init
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/SinhaVanya/MLProject.git
    git push -u origin main
    if we did change in my repository and want to be present in work area, do
    git pull
    
6. We need to create requirements.txt

    This will have all the packages that we really need to install while we are implementing the project

7. Now we need to have setup.py

    (This setup.py will be responsible in creating my machine learning application as a package. This package can be installed in our project or in another project as well.)
    in setup.py, install_requires, we put modules that we require. But it is not feasible to write all here.
    So instead of install_requires=['pandas','numpy,'seaborn'] write install_requires=get_requirements('E:\udemy\Data_Science\requirements.txt')

8.Create src folder

    Entire project development will happen in src folder

9. In src folder create __init__.py file.

    So whenever in setup.py, find_packages is there, it will just go and see how many folder have __init__.py then it will consider that as a package and will try to build this
    Once this is built it, we can import it anywhere whenever we want.
